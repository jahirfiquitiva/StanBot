# Ping-Pong-Bot

Ping-Pong-Bot was created to act as an example of how easy it is to create a bot using the open source [Simple-Slack-Bot library](https://greghilston.github.io/Simple-Slack-Bot/).

Ping-Pong-Bot will look at every message sent to the channels that it is in, waiting for the case insensitive message "Ping". Once received, Ping-Pong-Bot will write back to the very same channel "Pong".
